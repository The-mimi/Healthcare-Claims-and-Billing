# Healthcare Claims and Billing Insights Using SQL
**Objective:**
Evaluate the operational efficiency and financial performance of healthcare claims to identify patterns in processing times, denial rates, and cost discrepancies, guiding strategies for process improvement and cost reduction.

**Dataset Overview:**
The healthcare claims dataset contains comprehensive information about:
- ~4,000+ claims with dates, claim status (paid, denied, pending), and network status(in-network or out-of-network). 
- Operational Date: Denial reasons and priority flags for processing urgency.
- Financial Data: Billed amounts charged by providers, allowed amounts approved by payers, amounts paid by insurer, and member responsibilities(co-pays, deductibles).

# Healthcare-Claims-and-Billing
This analysis focuses on four interconnected domains of healthcare claims performance. Claims processing efficiency evaluates how quickly and consistently claims move to approval, identifying any delays or operational bottlenecks. Financial insights examine the relationships between billed, allowed, and paid amounts to highlight cost discrepancies that affect both patients and providers. Provider network performance compares in-network and out-of-network outcomes to assess how network status influences claim approval and patient costs. Finally, claim denial analysis investigates the leading causes and seasonal trends of denials.
